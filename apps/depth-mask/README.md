[![depth-mask-proof-of-concept](app/opengraph-image.jpg)](https://depth-mask.vercel.app/)

- Inpired by [this tweet](https://x.com/raunofreiberg/status/1787887279454683324) by [Rauno](https://x.com/raunofreiberg/) and building upon the Depth of field experiment and my previous experiment on [layers and pointclouds with CSS](https://javier.xyz/blog/css-pointcloud-experiment).

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```bash

pnpm dev
